# GemKeeper - Development Workflow

**Author:** Kay  
**Date:** January 22, 2026  
**Purpose:** Document the AI-assisted development workflow used to build GemKeeper

---

## Overview

GemKeeper was built using an AI-assisted development workflow combining:
- **Claude (Chat)** — Planning, strategy, documentation, and debugging
- **Claude Code** — Autonomous code implementation
- **Linear** — Project management and issue tracking

This workflow enables a non-developer (Product Manager) to build and ship production applications.

---

## The Two-Claude System

### Claude (Chat) — The Architect

**Role:** Strategic partner for planning, documentation, and problem-solving

**Responsibilities:**
- Create and refine product requirements
- Design database schemas
- Write TASKS.md files that guide Claude Code
- Debug issues by analyzing error messages
- Create Linear issues and organize work
- Answer technical questions
- Generate documentation

**When to Use:**
- Starting a new feature or epic
- When something is broken and you don't know why
- When you need to make architectural decisions
- When you need documents, PRDs, or specifications
- When you need to update project management tools

### Claude Code — The Builder

**Role:** Autonomous developer that implements code based on instructions

**Responsibilities:**
- Read TASKS.md and implement features
- Write code following existing patterns
- Create new files and components
- Run tests and verify functionality
- Create git branches and commits
- Generate pull requests

**When to Use:**
- When you have a clear TASKS.md with specific instructions
- For implementation work (not planning)
- When you need code written, modified, or debugged
- For testing and verification

## Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Planning with Claude (Chat)

**Start a conversation describing what you want to build.**

Example prompts:
- "I want to add AI extraction to my app. Help me plan this feature."
- "Users should be able to organize notes into folders. What do I need?"
- "Here's an error I'm seeing: [paste error]. Help me debug."

**Claude will:**
1. Ask clarifying questions
2. Design the solution
3. Create database schemas (SQL for Supabase)
4. Create a TASKS.md file with implementation steps
5. Update Linear issues if needed

**Your job:**
1. Answer Claude's questions
2. Run any SQL in Supabase
3. Add environment variables to Vercel if needed
4. Download the TASKS.md file

### Step 2: Building with Claude Code

**Start a NEW Claude Code session for each major feature.**

**Prompt template:**
```
Read TASKS.md and implement the features described.

Create a new branch, implement all tasks, test each one works,
and create a PR when complete.
```

**Claude Code will:**
1. Read the TASKS.md file
2. Create a git branch
3. Implement each task
4. Commit changes
5. Create a pull request

**Your job:**
1. Let it run (can take 10-30+ minutes for complex features)
2. Check in periodically to see progress
3. Answer any questions it asks

### Step 3: Review and Debug

**After Claude Code creates a PR:**

1. **Merge the PR** in GitHub
2. **Wait for Vercel** to deploy (1-2 minutes)
3. **Test the feature** in production
4. **Report any bugs** to Claude (Chat)

**If something is broken:**

1. Check browser console for errors (Cmd+Option+J on Mac)
2. Check Vercel logs for server errors
3. Share error messages with Claude (Chat)
4. Claude will diagnose and provide a fix
5. Give the fix to Claude Code to implement

### Step 4: Iterate

Repeat the loop for each new feature or fix.

## Best Practices

### For Planning (Claude Chat)

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Be specific about what you want | Give vague requirements |
| Share error messages and screenshots | Just say "it's broken" |
| Answer clarifying questions thoroughly | Skip questions |
| Review TASKS.md before sending to Claude Code | Blindly trust the plan |

### For Building (Claude Code)

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Start a new session for each major feature | Continue sessions indefinitely |
| Give it a clear TASKS.md | Give vague instructions |
| Let it complete before interrupting | Constantly change requirements mid-task |
| Review the PR before merging | Merge blindly |

### For Debugging

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Check browser console first | Panic |
| Check Vercel logs for server errors | Assume the worst |
| Share exact error messages | Paraphrase errors |
| Test one thing at a time | Change everything at once |

## Environment Variables

**Managed in Vercel Dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables**

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` | Supabase project URL |

## Session Management

### When to Start a New Claude Code Session

- Starting a new feature or epic
- After merging a PR
- When the current session seems confused
- After significant planning changes

### When to Continue a Session

- Fixing bugs in code just written
- Adding small tweaks to current work
- Answering follow-up questions

---

## Troubleshooting

### Claude Code seems stuck

- Check if it's waiting for input
- If unresponsive, start a new session
- Re-send the TASKS.md

### Build errors after merge

- Check Vercel deployment logs
- Ensure all environment variables are set
- Check for missing dependencies

### Database errors

- Verify tables exist in Supabase
- Check RLS policies allow the operation
- Ensure user is authenticated

### AI extraction not working

- Check GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY is set in Vercel
- Check rate limits (wait 1 minute and retry)
- Verify model name is correct
