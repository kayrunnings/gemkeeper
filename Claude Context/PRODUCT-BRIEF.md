# ThoughtFolio Product Brief

## Vision

**ThoughtFolio transforms passive knowledge consumption into active wisdom application.**

Most people capture insights but never revisit them. Highlights sit unread. Notes gather dust. The gap between learning and doing remains wide.

ThoughtFolio closes this gap by becoming your wisdom accountability partner — capturing your best insights and proactively surfacing them at moments they can actually change your behavior.

---

## Tagline

**Thoughts that find you.**

This captures the core value proposition: proactive surfacing. You don't have to remember to revisit your wisdom. Your wisdom finds you when you need it.

---

## Positioning

### What ThoughtFolio Is

- A wisdom accountability partner
- A system for applying what you learn
- A curator of your most important insights
- A coach that knows your values and reminds you of them

### What ThoughtFolio Is Not

- A note-taking app (we're not competing with Notion or Obsidian)
- A read-later service (we're not Pocket or Instapaper)
- A highlight aggregator (we're not Readwise, though we serve similar users)
- An AI that generates wisdom for you (your wisdom, your words)

### Competitive Differentiation

| Tool | What They Do | What's Missing |
|------|--------------|----------------|
| **Readwise** | Aggregates highlights, resurfaces randomly | No contextual timing, no behavior change focus |
| **Notion** | Stores everything | No proactive surfacing, becomes a graveyard |
| **Google NotebookLM** | AI-powered research | No personal wisdom, no accountability |
| **Journaling Apps** | Reflection capture | No resurfacing, no application prompts |

**ThoughtFolio's unique combination:**
1. Constraint-based curation (10 gems max)
2. Proactive, context-aware surfacing
3. Accountability mechanisms (daily prompts, moments)
4. Your wisdom, not AI-generated content

## Core Principles

### 1. Less is More

The 10-gem limit isn't a restriction — it's a feature. Constraints force prioritization. A focused collection of truly important insights beats an infinite archive of "maybe useful someday" highlights.

**Implication:** We never encourage hoarding. We celebrate archiving. We make users feel good about saying "this isn't in my top 10 anymore."

### 2. Application Over Accumulation

Success isn't measured in gems captured. It's measured in wisdom applied. Every feature should ask: "Does this help users actually use their insights?"

**Implication:** Daily prompts include action suggestions. Moments focus on preparation. We track "applied" status, not just "captured."

### 3. Right Gem, Right Time

Random resurfacing isn't enough. The right wisdom at the wrong time is noise. Context matters.

**Implication:** Calendar integration, individual scheduling, and moment matching all serve this principle. We invest in timing intelligence.

### 4. User's Words, User's Wisdom

We help users capture and resurface their own insights. We don't generate wisdom for them. The AI assists extraction and matching, but the substance comes from the user.

**Implication:** AI suggestions are always editable. We never put words in users' mouths. The gems belong to the user.

### 5. Gentle Accountability

We're a supportive coach, not a nagging reminder app. Accountability should feel empowering, not guilt-inducing.

**Implication:** Missed prompts don't stack up. No streaks or punitive mechanics. Encouragement over obligation.

## Brand Voice

### Tone

- **Warm but not saccharine** — Supportive coach, not chirpy app

- **Confident but humble** — We believe in the product, we don't oversell

### Example Copy

**Good:** "Time to make room — which gem has served its purpose?"
**Bad:** "Warning: You've reached your gem limit!"

**Good:** "This insight might help with your presentation tomorrow."
**Bad:** "Don't forget to apply your learnings! 🚀"

## Open Questions

Things we're still figuring out:

- **Monetization:** Freemium? Subscription? What's the free tier?
- **Mobile app:** When do we need native vs. responsive web?
- **Sharing:** Should users be able to share gems? With whom?
- **Integrations:** Which sources should we pull from automatically?

## Appendix: The Name

**ThoughtFolio** = Thoughts + Portfolio

- "Folio" connotes curation, collection, intentionality
- "Thought" is more accessible than "Wisdom" or "Insight"
- Together: a curated portfolio of your most important thoughts

Previously named "GemKeeper" — retired due to branding confusion (sounded like a game or jewelry app).
