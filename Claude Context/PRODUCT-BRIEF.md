# ThoughtFolio Product Brief

**Last Updated:** January 2026

## Vision

**ThoughtFolio transforms passive knowledge consumption into active application.**

Most people capture insights but never revisit them. Highlights sit unread. Notes gather dust. The gap between learning and doing remains wide.

ThoughtFolio closes this gap by becoming your knowledge accountability partner — capturing your best insights and proactively surfacing them at moments they can actually change your behavior.

---

## Tagline

**Thoughts that find you.**

This captures the core value proposition: proactive surfacing. You don't have to remember to revisit your knowledge. Your thoughts find you when you need them.

---

## Positioning

### What ThoughtFolio Is

- A knowledge accountability partner
- A system for applying what you learn
- A curator of your most important insights organized by life context
- A coach that knows your values and reminds you of them

### What ThoughtFolio Is Not

- A note-taking app (we're not competing with Notion or Obsidian)
- A read-later service (we're not Pocket or Instapaper)
- A highlight aggregator (we're not Readwise, though we serve similar users)
- An AI that generates thoughts for you (your knowledge, your words)

### Competitive Differentiation

| Tool | What They Do | What's Missing |
|------|--------------|----------------|
| **Readwise** | Aggregates highlights, resurfaces randomly | No contextual timing, no behavior change focus |
| **Notion** | Stores everything | No proactive surfacing, becomes a graveyard |
| **Google NotebookLM** | AI-powered research | No personal knowledge, no accountability |
| **Journaling Apps** | Reflection capture | No resurfacing, no application prompts |

**ThoughtFolio's unique combination:**
1. Context-based curation with accountability (Active List of 10)
2. Proactive, context-aware surfacing
3. Accountability mechanisms (daily prompts, moments)
4. Your knowledge, not AI-generated content
5. URL-based extraction from articles and videos
6. AI-powered discovery of new relevant content

## Core Principles

### 1. Focused Accountability

The Active List (10 thoughts max) isn't a restriction — it's a feature. While users can capture unlimited thoughts across contexts, the Active List forces them to choose what matters most right now. These are the thoughts that will appear in daily prompts.

**Implication:** We encourage broad capture but focused attention. The Active List represents "what I'm working on applying."

### 2. Application Over Accumulation

Success isn't measured in thoughts captured. It's measured in knowledge applied. Every feature should ask: "Does this help users actually use their insights?"

**Implication:** Daily prompts include action suggestions. Moments focus on preparation. We track "applied" status, not just "captured."

### 3. Right Thought, Right Time

Random resurfacing isn't enough. The right knowledge at the wrong time is noise. Context matters.

**Implication:** Calendar integration, individual scheduling, and moment matching all serve this principle. We invest in timing intelligence.

### 4. Organized by Life

Different life areas need different knowledge. Coding insights don't help in parenting moments. Relationship advice doesn't apply to technical problems.

**Implication:** Contexts let users organize by life domain. Moments search all contexts but surface contextually relevant thoughts.

### 5. User's Words, User's Knowledge

We help users capture and resurface their own insights. We don't generate knowledge for them. The AI assists extraction, discovery, and matching, but the substance comes from the user.

**Implication:** AI suggestions are always editable. We never put words in users' mouths. The thoughts belong to the user. Even in Discover, users edit before saving.

### 6. Gentle Accountability

We're a supportive coach, not a nagging reminder app. Accountability should feel empowering, not guilt-inducing.

**Implication:** Missed prompts don't stack up. No streaks or punitive mechanics. Encouragement over obligation.

## Open Questions

Things we're still figuring out:

- **Monetization:** Freemium? Subscription? What's the free tier?
- **Mobile app:** When do we need native vs. responsive web?
- **Sharing:** Should users be able to share thoughts? With whom?
- **Integrations:** Which sources should we pull from automatically?

## Appendix: The Name

**ThoughtFolio** = Thoughts + Portfolio

- "Folio" connotes curation, collection, intentionality
- "Thought" is more accessible than "Wisdom" or "Insight"
- Together: a curated portfolio of your most important thoughts

Previously named "GemKeeper" — retired due to branding confusion (sounded like a game or jewelry app).
