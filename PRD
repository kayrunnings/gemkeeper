# GemKeeper - Product Requirements Document

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** January 22, 2026  
**Author:** Kay  
**Status:** MVP Complete

---

## Executive Summary

GemKeeper is a **"thoughts that find you"** app that helps users capture, remember, and actually apply insights from books, podcasts, videos, and life experiences. Unlike traditional note-taking apps that become "digital graveyards," GemKeeper enforces a constraint of maximum 10 active gems, forcing users to prioritize what truly matters and commit to applying their wisdom.

---

## Problem Statement

People consume vast amounts of content — books, podcasts, articles, videos — and frequently encounter valuable insights. However:

1. **Capture without action**: Most insights get saved but never reviewed or applied
2. **Hoarding mentality**: Traditional apps encourage saving everything, leading to overwhelming, unmanageable collections
3. **No accountability**: No mechanism to ensure insights translate into behavior change
4. **Context disconnect**: Wisdom isn't surfaced at the moments when it's most relevant

---

## Solution

GemKeeper solves these problems through:

1. **Constrained capture**: Maximum 10 active "gems" forces prioritization
2. **AI-powered extraction**: Automatically extract insights from long-form content
3. **Proactive surfacing**: Daily prompts and check-ins to keep wisdom top-of-mind
4. **Accountability loop**: Track whether insights are actually being applied
5. **Graduation system**: Successfully applied gems move to a "Trophy Case"
